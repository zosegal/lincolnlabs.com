          <p><b>Is the NSA really trampling on our Constitution and civil liberties?</b></p>

          <p><img class="right" src="/img/brucefein.jpg" alt="" />Hundreds of thousands of files released by Edward Snodwen exposed a massive program to mine private citizen information at an unpredecented scale. While some disagree on the merits and honor of Snowden's release, exposing such a big secret has started the discussion on the state of our privacy and civil rights when it comes to online information. <br /><br />Watch this conversation with Bruce Fein, former Snowden Family Lawyer and Constitutional & International Law Scholar, and hear his perspective on the state of our civil liberties and internet privacy.</p>
